## What’s the story

**Councils across the UK are bound into decades worth of contracts with companies to burn black bag waste - even though experts now say incineration is a “disaster” for the environment.**

Over the past decade, local authorities have greatly reduced the amount of household waste  they send to landfill. 

But the BBC Climate and Science team's investigation alongside the Shared Data Unit shows the alternative many have found may not be the green solution it has been sold as. 

Instead, councils are burning millions of tonnes more than they did a decade ago in large “energy from waste” facilities - most often situated in the poorest parts of the UK.

These incinerators generate electricity for the National Grid, but are pumping out levels of harmful greenhouse gases at a rising rate.

This website enables you to see how incineration levels have changed at your authority comparing the 2014-15 financial year, when statistics first became available, and 2022-23, the most recent available. The most recent year available in Scotland was the 2022 calender year.

By selecting the waste authority from the drop down menus above - you can also get details of the authority’s contract term and value.

Please note some areas have joint waste authorities covering multiple council areas, such as the Merseyside Waste Disposal Authority. Mostly, the waste authority for your area will be the upper-tier council.
